                            <p>Inspired by the silhouettes of racing yachts from the America’s Cup, the J12 is an
                                icon of 21st-century watchmaking. Highly resistant ceramic, available in brilliant black
                                or intense white. An enduring and timeless watch.</p>

                                It all begins with the creative act. Transforming an idea, an inspiration, into a watch
                                with an incomparable and timeless design.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Precise lines, graphic perfection, state-of-the-art technology. The J12 was designed in
                                Paris by the Watch Creation Studio at Place Vendôme, then manufactured and assembled by
                                the CHANEL Manufacture at Chaux-de-Fonds, the birthplace of Swiss watchmaking.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first J12 was released by Jacques Helleu in 2000 after 7 years of research.

                                    In 2019, the Caliber 12.1 and the precision of its movement were laid bare by Arnaud
                                    Chastaingt.

                                    It took 6 years to create the Caliber 12.1. High-performing and resistant, this
                                    self-winding movement manufactured exclusively for CHANEL and chronometer-certified

                                    50 experts are needed to build one J12.

                                    The manufacturing of the J12 is extremely detailed work, requiring the intervention
                                    of
                                    50 expert watchmakers throughout the entire process, from design to production. A

                                    The wrist’s movement provides the energy needed for the watch to work. When it’s not
